To be, or not to be- that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
<<<< Page >>>>
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
<<<< Page >>>>
And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
<<<< Page >>>>
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
<<<< Page >>>>
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
<<<< Page >>>>
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
<<<< Page >>>>
Must give us pause. There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
<<<< Page >>>>
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
<<<< Page >>>>
The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
<<<< Page >>>>
That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
<<<< Page >>>>
With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
<<<< Page >>>>
But that the dread of something after death-
The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
<<<< Page >>>>
No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
<<<< Page >>>>
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
<<<< Page >>>>
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
<<<< Page >>>>
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
<<<< Page >>>>
And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
<<<< Page >>>>
Be all my sins rememb'red.
